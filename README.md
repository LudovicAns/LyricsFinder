# 🔎 LyricsFinder 🔍

📜 This is a training project in Python. It is used to get all songs lyrics of an artist from
[genius.com](https://genius.com/) and put them directly in a directory.

💡 I used a hybrid method by using web-scraping and web-request. It can be done in a better
way (API 🙄) but it's not very funny.
